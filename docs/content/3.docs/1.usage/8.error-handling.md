# Error handling

## Handling errors

Nuxt 3 is a full-stack framework, which means there are several sources of unpreventable user runtime errors that can happen in different contexts:

1. Errors during the Vue rendering lifecycle (SSR + SPA)
1. Errors during API or Nitro server lifecycle
1. Server and client startup errors (SSR + SPA)

### Errors during the Vue rendering lifecycle (SSR + SPA)

You can hook into Vue errors using [`onErrorCaptured`](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-lifecycle.html#onerrorcaptured).

In addition, Nuxt provides a `vue:error` hook that will be called if there are any errors that propagate up to the top level.

If you are using a error reporting framework, you can provide a global handler through [`vueApp.config.errorHandler`](https://vuejs.org/api/application.html#app-config-errorhandler). It will receive all Vue errors, even if they are handled.

#### Example with global error reporting framework

```js
export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.config.errorHandler = (error, context) => {
    // ...
  }
})
```

### Server and client startup errors (SSR + SPA)

Nuxt will call the `app:error` hook if there are any errors in starting your Nuxt application.

This includes:

* running Nuxt plugins
* processing `app:created` and `app:beforeMount` hooks
* mounting the app (on client-side), though you should handle this case with `onErrorCaptured` or with `vue:error`
* processing the `app:mounted` hook

### Errors during API or Nitro server lifecycle

You cannot currently define a server-side handler for these errors, but can render an error page (see the next section).

## Rendering an error page

When Nuxt encounters a fatal error, whether during the server lifecycle, or when rendering your Vue application (both SSR and SPA), it will either render a JSON response (if requested with `Accept: application/json` header) or an HTML error page.

You can customize this error page by adding `~/error.vue` in the source directory of your application, alongside `app.vue`. This page has a single prop - `error` which contains an error for you to handle.

When you are ready to remove the error page, you can call the `clearError` helper function, which takes an optional path to redirect to (for example, if you want to navigate to a 'safe' page).

::alert{type="warning"}
Make sure to check before using anything dependent on Nuxt plugins, such as `$route` or `useRouter`, as if a plugin threw an error, then it won't be re-run until you clear the error.
::

### Example

```vue [error.vue]
<template>
  <button @click="handleError">Clear errors</button>
</template>

<script setup>
const props = defineProps({
  error: Object
})

const handleError = () => clearError({ redirect: '/' })
</script>
```

## Error helper methods

### useError

* `function useError (): Ref<any>`

This function will return the global Nuxt error that is being handled.

### throwError

* `function throwError (err: string | Error): Error`

You can call this function at any point on client-side, or (on server side) directly within middleware, plugins or `setup()` functions. It will trigger a full-screen error page (as above) which you can clear with `clearError`.

### clearError

* `function clearError (redirect?: string): Promise<void>`

This function will clear the currently handled Nuxt error. It also takes an optional path to redirect to (for example, if you want to navigate to a 'safe' page).

## Rendering errors within your app

Nuxt also provides a `<NuxtErrorBoundary>` component that allows you to handle client-side errors within your app, without replacing your entire site with an error page.

This component is responsible for handling errors that occur within its default slot. On client-side, it will prevent the error from bubbling up to the top level, and will render the `#error` slot instead.

The `#error` slot will receive `error` as a prop. (If you set `error = null` it will trigger re-rendering the default slot; you'll need to ensure that the error is fully resolved first or the error slot will just be rendered a second time.)

::alert{type="info"}
If you navigate to another route, the error will be cleared automatically.
::

### Example

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<template>
  <!-- some content --> 
  <NuxtErrorBoundary @error="someErrorLogger">
    <!-- You use the default slot to render your content --> 
    <template #error="{ error }">
      You can display the error locally here.
      <button @click="error = null">
        This will clear the error.
      </button>
    </template>
  </NuxtErrorBoundary>
</template>
```
