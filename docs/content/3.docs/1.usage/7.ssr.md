## useReqHeaders

Within your pages, components and plugins you can use `useReqHeaders` to access the incoming request headers.

```js
const headers = useReqHeaders()
```

::alert{icon=ðŸ‘‰}
On client side, `useReqHeaders` will return an empty object.
::

### Options

- **`exclude`** Specifies headers not to include in the returned object.
- **`include`**: Specifies headers to include in the returned object

### Example

The example below adds the request headers to an isomorphic `$fetch` call to ensure that the API endpoint has access to the same headers originally sent by user.

```vue
<script setup>
const { data } = useFetch('/api/me', {
  headers: useReqHeaders()
})
</script>
```

### Using with external APIs

When using `fetch` to call an external API endpoint, not all headers are safe to be proxified and might introduce unwanted behavior.

It is adviced to always use `include` and proxy a set of known and required headers.

If you prefer using exclude method, here is a list of common headers are NOT to be proxified:

- `host`, `accept`
- `content-length`, `content-md5`, `content-type`
- `x-forwarded-host`, `x-forwarded-port`, `x-forwarded-proto`
- `cf-connecting-ip`, `cf-ray`
