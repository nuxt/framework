# Gitignore file

A `.gitignore` file specifies intentionally untracked files that git should ignore. Learn more about it in [the git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

We recommend to have a `.gitignore` file which has **at least** the following lines present:

```bash [.gitignore]
# Nuxt dev/build outputs
.output
.nuxt
# Node dependencies
node_modules
# System files
*.log
```
