# Netlify

How to deploy Nuxt to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

::list
- Support for serverless SSR build
- Auto-detected when deploying
- No configuration required
::

## Setup

Nitro will auto-detect that you are in a Netlify environment and build the correct version of your Nuxt server. The only thing you need to do is ensure that you have Netlify set up to build your project (just select the 'Nuxt' preset from the drop-down menu).

## Deployment

Just push to your git repository [as you would normally for Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/getting-started/).

## More information

See [more information on the lambda preset](/deployment/presets/lambda) for full details.

## Demo

A live demo is available on https://nuxt-nitro.netlify.app/
