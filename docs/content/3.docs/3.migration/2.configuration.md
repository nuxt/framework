# Project Configuration

## `nuxt.config`

The starting point for your Nuxt app remains your `nuxt.config` file. This can now be written in TypeScript, if you would like.

::alert{icon=ðŸ“¦}
Your configuration will be loaded using [`unjs/c12`](https://github.com/unjs/c12) and normalized with [`unjs/untyped`](https://github.com/unjs/untyped).
::

### Migration

You should migrate to the new `defineNuxtConfig` function that provides a typed configuration schema.

::code-group

```ts [Nuxt 2]
export default {
  // ...
}
```

```ts [Nuxt 3]
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt3'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...
})
```

::

## Modules

Nuxt modules are now build-time-only.

You can check the support status of any modules you are using at <https://modules.nuxtjs.org/?version=3.x>. Feel free to open an issue requesting migration to Nuxt 3 in the module repository. (Note that there are a number of core Nuxt modules that can be tracked on the [Nuxt 3 roadmap](/community/roadmap/).)

If you are a module author, you can check out [more information about module compatibility](/docs/migration/module-authors) and [our module author guide](/docs/advanced/modules).

### Migration

1. Move all your `buildModules` into `modules`.

## TypeScript

It will be much easier to migrate your application if you use Nuxt's TypeScript integration. This does not mean you need to write your application in TypeScript, just that Nuxt will provide automatic type hints for your editor.

You can read more about Nuxt's TypeScript support [in the docs](/docs/concepts/typescript).

::alert{icon=ðŸ“¦}
Nuxt can type-check your app using [`vue-tsc`](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/tree/master/packages/vue-tsc).
::

### Migration

1. Create a `tsconfig.json` with the following content:

   ```json
   {
     "extends": "./.nuxt/tsconfig.json"
   }
   ```

1. Run `npx nuxi prepare` to generate `.nuxt/tsconfig.json`.
1. Install Volar following the instructions in the [docs](/docs/getting-started/introduction).

## Vue changes

There are a number of changes to what is recommended Vue best practice, as well as a number of breaking changes between Vue 2 and 3.

It is recommended to read the [Vue 3 migration guide](https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/) and in particular the [breaking changes list](https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/breaking-changes/).

It is not currently possible to use the Vue 3 migration build with Nuxt 3 RC.

## Vuex

Nuxt no longer provides a Vuex integration. Instead, the official Vue recommendation is to use `pinia`, which has built-in Nuxt support via a Nuxt module. [Find out more about pinia here](https://pinia.vuejs.org/).

If you want to keep using Vuex, you can manually migrate to Vuex 4 following [these steps](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/migrating-to-4-0-from-3-x.html).
