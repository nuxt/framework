# Nuxt Bridge

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This section is work-in-progress and can change. Please check this page regularly.

Nuxt3 brings a brand-new experience for developing Vue applications.

To make this happen, we've rewritten most parts of nuxt codebase and are using the latest tooling such as Webpack5, Vite, vue3 and native ESM.
And we've also rethought how nuxt rendering works by introducing the `@nuxt/nitro` project.

Our goal is a smooth transition path from legacy stack to new one, reducing breaking changes as much as possible.

To make this happen, we considered backward- and forward-compatibility and most layers (such as modules and plugins). Nonetheless, this is in progress and a bumpy road.

In the meantime, you can make sure your project is almost ready for nuxt3 and have the latest DX experience without major rewrites and risk of breaking changes by adding a simple module.

üëâ Please see [Migration Guide](./migration) for more details on how you can migrate your nuxt 2 project or module to bridge level.
