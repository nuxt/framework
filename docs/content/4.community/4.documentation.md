## Word list

## Writing tips

- Avoid subjective words like _simply_, _just_, _obviously..._ when possible.

  Keep in mind your readers can have different background and experience. These words don't convey meaning and can be harmful.

  ::alert{icon=❌}
  **Avoid:** "Simply make sure the function returns a promise."

  ::alert{icon=✅}
  **Prefer:** "Make sure the function returns a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)."

- Prefer [active voice](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/active-voice).
