## Getting started

### Quick edits

If you spot a typo or want to rephrase a sentence, you can click on the **Edit this page on GitHub** link located after the content of every page.
Make the change directly in the GitHub interface and open a Pull Request.

Note: the [config section](/docs/directory-structure/nuxt.config) is auto-generated from JSDocs (see [gen-docs.ts](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/blob/main/docs/scripts/gen-docs.ts)).

### Longer contributions

The documentation is inside the `docs/` directory of the [framework repository](https://github.com/nuxt/framework) and written in markdown.

To contribute, fork the repository and follow these steps:

```bash
yarn
```

```bash
yarn stub
```

```bash
cd docs
```

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

After making your changes:

- Lint the documentation with the `lint:docs` command.
- Open a Pull Request. Please make sure your PR title adheres to the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines.

## Word list

To keep the documentation cohesive, a word list is in the making. In the meantime, we use [case police](https://github.com/antfu/case-police) as a CI guard.

## Writing tips

- Avoid subjective words like _simply_, _just_, _obviously..._ when possible.

  Keep in mind your readers can have different background and experience. These words don't convey meaning and can be harmful.

  ::alert{icon=‚ùå}
  **Avoid:** "Simply make sure the function returns a promise."
  ::

  ::alert{icon=‚úÖ}
  **Prefer:** "Make sure the function returns a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)."
  ::

- Prefer [active voice](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/active-voice).

  ::alert{icon=‚ùå}
  **Avoid:** "An error will be thrown by Nuxt."
  ::

  ::alert{icon=‚úÖ}
  **Prefer:** "Nuxt will throw an error."
