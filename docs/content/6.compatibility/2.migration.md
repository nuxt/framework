# Migration Guide

**ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§**

The following steps are intended as a helpful guide for the process of converting an existing Nuxt app to upgrade to Nuxt3.

1. Upgrade your project to the latest version of Nuxt 2, including following any steps detailed in the migration guide.

2. Upgrade your dependencies to the latest version supported by Nuxt 2, ensuring at each stage that your project is still working as intended.
   1. Install `core-js@3`.
   2. Install and enable [`nuxt-postcss8`](https://github.com/nuxt/postcss8) to migrate to PostCSS 8.

3. Upgrade your project Nuxt dependencies, removing now-unneeded packages.
   ```diff {}[package.json]
   {
     "dependencies: {
   -    "nuxt-postcss8": "latest",
   -    "core-js": "3",
   -    "nuxt": "^2.15.6"
     },
     "devDependencies": {
   +    "nuxt3": "latest"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Upgrade any webpack-ecosystem packages (loaders, plugins, etc.) to their webpack5 equivalents. For example, `sass-loader` can be upgraded to v12.
