    :headline[Nitro Engine]

    We worked for 9 months on Nuxt's new server engine for Nuxt: [**Nitro**](/guide/concepts/server-engine). It unlocks new **full-stack capabilities** to Nuxt server and beyond.

    In development, it uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) and [Node.js workers](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html) for your server code and context isolation. It also **generates your server API** by reading files in [`server/api/`](/guide/directory-structure/server#api-routes) and **server middleware** from [`server/middleware/`](/guide/directory-structure/server#server-middleware).

    In production, it builds your app and server into one universal [`.output`](/guide/directory-structure/output) directory. This **output is light**: minified and removed from any Node.js modules (except polyfills). You can deploy this output on any system supporting JavaScript, from Node.js, Serverless, Workers, Edge-side rendering or purely static.

    The output is combined with both runtime code to run your Nuxt server in any environment (including experimental browser Service Workers!) and serve you static files, making it a **true hybrid framework** for the JAMStack. In addition, a native storage layer is implemented, supporting multi source, drivers and local assets.

    The foundation of the Nitro server is rollup and [h3](https://github.com/unjs/h3): a minimal http framework built for high performance and portability.

    :headline[Nuxt Bridge]

    We moved to [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) and re-wrote Nuxt after 4 years of development to make it a strong foundation for the future.

    ### Smooth upgrade to Nuxt 3

    We've worked to make the upgrade as easy as possible between Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3.

    ::list
    - Legacy plugins and modules will keep working
    - Nuxt 2 config is compatible
    - Partial pages options API available
    ::

    ### Bringing Nuxt 3 experience to your existing Nuxt 2 project

    As we've been working on new features for Nuxt 3, we've back-ported some of them to Nuxt 2.

    ::list{.mb-8}
    - Using [Nitro server](/guide/concepts/server-engine) with Nuxt 2
    - Using Composition API (same as Nuxt 3) with Nuxt 2
    - Using new CLI and DevTools with Nuxt 2
    - Progressively upgrade to Nuxt 3
    - Compatibility with Nuxt 2 module ecosystem
    - Upgrade piece by piece (Nitro, Composition API, Nuxt Kit)
