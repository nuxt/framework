# SEO and Meta

Improve your Nuxt apps SEO with powerful head config, composables and components.

## App Head

Providing an [app.head](/api/configuration/nuxt-config#head) property in your `nuxt.config.ts` allows you to customize the head for your entire app.

This method does not allow you to provide reactive data, if you need global reactive data you can use `useHead` in `app.vue`.

### Defaults

Out-of-the-box, Nuxt provides sane defaults, which you can override if needed.

- `charset`: `utf-8`
- `viewport`: `width=device-width, initial-scale=1`

### Example

```ts{}[nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  app: {
    head: {
      title: 'My App',
      // <meta charset="utf-16">
      charset: 'utf-16',
      meta: [
        // <meta name="description" content="My amazing site">
        { name: 'description', content: 'My amazing site.' }
      ],
    }
  }
})
```

## Composable: `useHead`

The `useHead` composable function allows you to manage your head tags in a programmatic and reactive way, powered by [@vueuse/head](https://github.com/vueuse/head).

As with all composables, it can only be used with a components `setup` and lifecycle hooks.

### Example

```vue{}[app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({
  title: 'My App',
  meta: [
    { name: 'description', content: 'My amazing site.' }
  ],
  bodyAttrs: {
    class: 'test'
  },
  script: [ { children: 'console.log(\'Hello world\') } ]
})
</script>
```

### Reactivity

Reactivity is supported on all properties, as computed, computed getter refs and reactive.

It's recommended to use computed getters (`() => {}`) over computed (`computed(() => {})`).

```vue{}[app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const desc = ref('My amazing site.')

useHead({
  title: () => `Blog: ${useRoute().meta.title}`,
  meta: [
    { name: 'description', content: desc }
  ],
})
</script>
```

### Title Templates

You can use the `titleTemplate` option to provide a dynamic template for customizing the title of your site. for example, by adding the name of your site to the title of every page.

The `titleTemplate` can either be a string, where `%s` is replaced with the title, or a function.

If you want to use a function (for full control), then this cannot be set in your `nuxt.config`, and it is recommended instead to set it within your `app.vue` file, where it will apply to all pages on your site:

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
  useHead({
    titleTemplate: (titleChunk) => {
      return titleChunk ? `${titleChunk} - Site Title` : 'Site Title';
    }
  })
</script>
```

Now, if you set the title to `My Page` with `useHead` on another page of your site, the title would appear as 'My Page - Site Title' in the browser tab. You could also pass `null` to default to the site title.

### Body Tags

You can use the `body: true` option on the `link` and `script` meta tags to append them to the end of the `<body>` tag.

For example:

```vue{}[app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({
  script: [
    {
      src: 'https://third-party-script.com',
      body: true
    }
  ]
})
</script>
```

## Components

Nuxt provides `<Title>`, `<Base>`, `<Script>`, `<NoScript>`, `<Style>`, `<Meta>`, `<Link>`, `<Body>`, `<Html>` and `<Head>` components so that you can interact directly with your metadata within your component's template.

Because these component names match native HTML elements, it is very important that they are capitalized in the template.

`<Head>` and `<Body>` can accept nested meta tags (for aesthetic reasons) but this has no effect on _where_ the nested meta tags are rendered in the final HTML.

For example:

<!-- @case-police-ignore html -->

```vue{}[app.vue]
<script setup>
const title = ref('Hello World')
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <Head>
      <Title>{{ title }}</Title>
      <Meta name="description" :content="title" />
      <Style type="text/css" children="body { background-color: green; }" />
    </Head>

    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```
