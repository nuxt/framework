# Installation

Getting started with Nuxt3 is straightforward.

> Please skip this section if want to upgrade an existing Nuxt 2 project and go to [Bridge](/getting-started/bridge) instead.
> Learn more in the [Introduction](/getting-started/introduction).

## âœ¨ Create a new project

Open a terminal, or from visual studio code, open an [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) and use the following command to create a new starter project:

```bash
npx nuxi init my-nuxt3-website
```

Open `my-nuxt3-projewebsitect` folder in visual studio code:

```bash
code -r my-nuxt3-website
```

Install dependencies using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## ðŸš€ Start Development Server

Now you'll be able to use `yarn dev` to start nuxt app in development mode:

```bash
yarn dev -o
```

âœ¨Well done! A browser window should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`
