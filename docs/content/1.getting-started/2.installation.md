If you have enabled **Take Over Mode** or installed the **TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)**, you can disable generating the shim for `*.vue` files in your `nuxt.config` file:

```js
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  typescript: {
    shim: false
  }
})
```

## New Project

Open a terminal, or from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), open an [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) and use the following command to create a new starter project:

::code-group

```bash [npx]
npx nuxi init nuxt-app
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dlx nuxi init nuxt-app
```

::

Open `nuxt-app` folder in Visual Studio Code:

```bash
code nuxt-app
```

Install the dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn install
```

```bash [npm]
npm install
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

::

## Development Server

Now you'll be able to start your Nuxt app in development mode:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev -o
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev -- -o
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev -o
```

::
