```bash
npx nuxi init nuxt3-app
```

Open `nuxt3-app` folder in visual studio code:

```bash
code nuxt3-app
```

Install the dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [Yarn]
yarn install
```

```bash [NPM]
npm install
```

## Development server

Now you'll be able to use `yarn dev` to start your nuxt app in development mode:
