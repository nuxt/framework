## New project

```bash
npx nuxi init nuxt3-app
```

Open `nuxt3-app` folder in visual studio code:

```bash
code -r nuxt3-app
```

Install the dependencies:

::code-group
```bash [Yarn]
yarn install
```
```bash [NPM]
npm install
```

## Development Server

Now you'll be able to use `yarn dev` to start nuxt app in development mode:

::code-group
```bash [Yarn]
yarn dev -o

```bash [NPM]
npm run dev -- -o
```
