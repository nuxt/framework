# Views

Nuxt provides 4 layers to manage the User Interface of your application. Each View is composed of Vue Single File Components (SFCs)

## `App.vue`

![The app.vue file is the entry point of your application](/img/getting-started/views/app.svg)

By default, Nuxt will treat this file as the **entrypoint** and serve its content at the `/` **route** of our application.

```vue [App.vue]
<template>
  <div>
   <h1>Welcome to the homepage</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```

::alert
ðŸ’¡ If you are familiar with Vue, you might wonder where is the `main.js` file that creates a Vue app. Nuxt does this behind the scene.
::

## Components

![Components are reusable pieces of UI](/img/getting-started/views/components.svg)

Unlike `app.vue`, most components are not pages of our application, but reusable pieces of user interface, like buttons or menus. In Nuxt, you can create these components in the `components/` directory for them to be available across your application without having to explicitly import them, contrary to Vue.js.

::code-group

```vue [App.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to the homepage</h1>
    <AppAlert>
      This is an auto-imported component
    </AppAlert>
  </div>
</template>
```

```vue [components/AppAlert.vue]
<template>
  <span>
    <slot />
  </span>
</template>
```

::

## Pages

![Pages are views tied to a specific route](/img/getting-started/views/pages.svg)

Pages represent views tied to a specific route. Every file in the `pages/` directory represents a different route displaying its content.

To use pages, delete the `App.vue` file and move its content in a `pages/index.vue` file. You can now create more pages and their corresponding routes by adding new files in the `pages/` directory.

::code-group

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<template>
  <div>
   <h1>Welcome to the homepage</h1>
    <AppAlert>
      This is an auto-imported component
    </AppAlert>
  </div>
</template>
```

```vue [pages/about.vue]
<template>
  <section>
    <p>This page will be displayed at the /about route.</p>
  </section>
</template>
```

::alert
You will learn more about pages in the [Routing section](/getting-started/routing)

## Layouts

![Layouts are wrapper around pages](/img/getting-started/views/layouts.svg)

Layouts are wrapper around pages that contain a common User Interface for several pages, such as a header and footer display. Layouts are Vue files using `<slot />` components to display the **pages** content. The `layout/default.vue` file will be used by default. Custom layouts can be set as part of your page metadata.

::alert
If you only have a single layout in your application, we recommend using app.vue with the [`<NuxtPage />` component](/api/components/nuxt-page) instead.
::

::code-group

```vue [layouts/default.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <AppHeader />
      <slot />
    <AppFooter />
  </div>
</template>
```

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<template>
  <div>
   <h1>Welcome to the homepage</h1>
    <AppAlert>
      This is an auto-imported component
    </AppAlert>
  </div>
</template>
```

```vue [pages/about.vue]
<template>
  <section>
    <p>This page will be displayed at the /about route.</p>
  </section>
</template>
```
