# Views

## `App.vue`

![The app.vue file is the entry point of your application](/3.x/img/views/app.png)

By default, Nuxt will treat this file as the **entrypoint** and serve its content at the `/` **route** of our application.

```vue [App.vue]
<template>
  <div>
   <HelloNuxt />
  </div>
</template>
```

::alert
ðŸ’¡ If you are familiar with Vue, you might wonder where is the `main.js` file that creates a Vue app. Nuxt does this behind the scene.
::

## Components

![Components are reusable pieces of UI](/3.x/img/views/components.png)

Unlike `app.vue`, most components are not pages of our application, but reusable pieces of user interface, like buttons or menus. In Nuxt, you can create these components in the `components/` directory for them to be available across your application without having to explicitly import them, contrary to Vue.js.

::code-group

```vue [App.vue]
<template>
  <div>
   <AppAlert>
    This is an auto-imported component
   </AppAlert>
  </div>
</template>
```

```vue [components/AppAlert.vue]
<template>
  <span>
    <slot />
  </span>
</template>
```

::

## Pages

![Pages are views tied to a specific route](/3.x/img/views/pages.png)

Pages represent views tied to a specific route. Every file in the `pages/` directory represents a different route displaying its content. 

To use pages, replace the content of `App.vue` with the built-in `<NuxtPage />` component.

::code-group

```vue [App.vue]
<template>
  <div>
   <NuxtPage />
  </div>
</template>
```

```vue [pages/about.vue]
<template>
  <section>
    <p>This page will be displayed at the /about route.</p>
  </section>
</template>
```

::alert

## Layouts

![Layouts are wrapper around pages](/3.x/img/views/layouts.png)

Layouts are wrapper around pages that contain a User Interface that is common to several pages, such as a header and footer display. Layouts are used by adding `<NuxtLayout>` built-in component to your `App.vue` file, and setting a layout property as part of your page metadata.

::alert
If you only have a single layout in your application, we recommend using app.vue instead.
::

::code-group

```vue [App.vue]
<template>
  <div>
   <NuxtLayout />
  </div>
</template>
```

```vue [layouts/Blog.vue]
<template>
  <div>
   <BlogHeader />
    <slot />
   <BlogFooter />
  </div> 
</template>
```

```vue [pages/Article.vue]
<template>
  <p>
    This content will be displayed in the <slot/> of the 'blog' layout
  </p>
</template>

<script>
  definePageMeta({
    layout: 'blog'
  });
</script>
```
