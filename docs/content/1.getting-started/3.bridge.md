Bridge is a forward-compatibility layer that allows you to experience many of new Nuxt 3 features by simply installing and enabling a Nuxt module.

Using Nuxt Bridge, you can make sure your project is (almost) ready for Nuxt 3 and have the best developer experience without needing a major rewrite¬†or risk breaking changes.


### Upgrade Nuxt 2

Remove any package lockfiles (`package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock`) and use the latest `nuxt-edge`:

**package.json**

```diff
- "nuxt": "^2.15.0"
+ "nuxt-edge": "latest"
```

Then, reinstall your dependencies:

::code-group
```bash [Yarn]
yarn install
```
```bash [NPM]
npm install
```
::

::alert
Once the installation is complete, make sure both development and production builds are working as expected before proceeding.
::

### Install Nuxt Bridge

Install `@nuxt/bridge-edge` as a development dependency:

::code-group
```bash [NPM]
npm install -D @nuxt/bridge@npm:@nuxt/bridge-edge
```
```bash [Yarn]
yarn add --dev @nuxt/bridge@npm:@nuxt/bridge-edge
```
::

### Update `nuxt.config`

Please make sure to avoid any CommonJS syntax such as `module.exports`, `require` or `require.resolve` in your config file. It will soon be deprecated and unsupported.

You can use static `import`, dynamic `import()` and `export default` instead. Using TypeScript by renaming to `nuxt.config.ts` is also possible and recommended.

```ts [nuxt.config.js]
import { defineNuxtConfig } from '@nuxt/bridge'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // Your existing configuration
})
```

### Avoid CommonJS syntax

Nuxt 3 natively supports TypeScript and ECMAScript modules.

In every file make sure to:
- Change `require('lib')` to `import lib from 'lib'` or `await import('lib').then(e => e.default || e)`
- Change `module.exports` to `export default` or `export const`
- Avoid usage of `__dirname` and `__filename` as much as possible

### Remove incompatible and obsolete modules

- Remove `@nuxt/content` (1.x) a v2 rewrite for nuxt 3 support is planned, or you may also use docus
- Remove `nuxt-vite`: Bridge enables same functionality
- Remove `@nuxtjs/typescript-build`: Bridge enables same functionality
- Remove `@nuxtjs/typescript-runtime` and `nuxt-ts`: Nuxt 2 has built-in runtime support
- Remove `@nuxt/nitro`: Bridge injects same functionality
- Remove `@nuxtjs/composition-api`: Bridge provides a Nuxt 3 compatible composition-api layer and help to remove dependency

### Ensure everything goes well

‚úîÔ∏è Try with `nuxt dev` and `nuxt build` (or `nuxt generate`) to see if everything goes well.

üêõ Is something wrong? Please let us know by creating an issue. Also, you can easily disable bridge in the meantime:

```ts [nuxt.config.js]
import { defineNuxtConfig } from '@nuxt/bridge'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  bridge: false // Temporarily disable bridge integration
})
```
