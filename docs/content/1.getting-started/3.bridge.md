# Bridge

Experience Nuxt 3 on existing Nuxt 2 projects

> Please skip this section if starting a new Nuxt 3 project and go to [Installation](/getting-started/installation) instead.

Bridge, is a forward-compatibility layer as a module that allows you to opt-in and experience many of new Nuxt 3 features.
Using bridge, you can make sure your project is almost ready for Nuxt 3 and have the latest DX experience without major rewrites and risk of breaking changes by adding a simple module.


### **Step 1:**  Upgrade to the latest version of Nuxt 2

Remove package lock-file (`package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock`) and use latest `nuxt-edge`:

**package.json**

```diff
- "nuxt": "^2.15.0"
+ "nuxt-edge": "latest"
```

‚úîÔ∏è After upgrade, please make sure both development and production builds are working fine before proceed to the module installation.

### **Step 2:**  Install bridge module

Install `@nuxt/bridge-edge` as a devDependency:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -D @nuxt/bridge@npm:@nuxt/bridge-edge

# Using yarn
yarn add --dev @nuxt/bridge@npm:@nuxt/bridge-edge
```

### **Step 3:** Update `nuxt.config`

Please make sure to avoid any CommonJS syntax such as `module.exports`, `require` or `require.resolve` in config file. It will be soon deprecated and unsupported. You can use static `import`, dynamic `import()` and `export default` instead. Using typescript by renaming to `nuxt.config.ts` is also possible and recommended.

```ts [nuxt.config.js]
import { defineNuxtConfig } from '@nuxt/bridge'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // Your existing configuration
})
```

### **Step 4:** Avoid CommonJS syntax

Nuxt natively supports TypeScript and ECMAScript modules. In every file make sure to:

- Change `require('lib')` to `import lib from 'lib'` or `await import('lib').then(e => e.default || e)`
- Change `module.exports` to `export default` or `export const`
- Avoid usage of `__dirname` and `__filename` as much as possible

### **Step 5:** Remove incompatible and obsolete modules

- Remove `@nuxt/content` (1.x) a v2 rewrite for nuxt 3 support is planned, or you may also use docus
- Remove `nuxt-vite`: Bridge enables same functionality
- Remove `@nuxtjs/typescript-build`: Bridge enables same functionality
- Remove `@nuxtjs/typescript-runtime` and `nuxt-ts`: Nuxt 2 has built-in runtime support
- Remove `@nuxt/nitro`: Bridge injects same functionality
- Remove `@nuxtjs/composition-api`: Bridge provides a Nuxt 3 compatible composition-api layer and help to remove dependency

### **Step 6:** Ensure everything goes well

‚úîÔ∏è Try with `nuxt dev` and `nuxt build` (or `nuxt generate`) to see if everything goes well.

üêõ Something is wrong? Please report us by creating an issue. Also, you can easily disable bridge in the meantime:

```ts [nuxt.config.js]
import { defineNuxtConfig } from '@nuxt/bridge'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  bridge: false // Temporary disable bridge integration
})
```
