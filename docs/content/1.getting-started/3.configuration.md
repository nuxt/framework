# Configuration

By default, Nuxt is configured to cover most use cases. The `nuxt.config.ts` file can override this default configuration, and provide custom variables.

## The `nuxt.config.ts` file

The configuration file is located at the root of a Nuxt project and can override or extend the application's behavior.

A minimal configuration file exports the `defineNuxtConfig` function containing an object with your configuration. The `defineNuxtConfig` helper is globally available without import.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // My Nuxt config
})
```

This file will often be mentioned in the documentation, for example to add custom scripts, register modules or change rendering modes.

Every configuration option is described in the [Configuration Reference](/api/configuration/nuxt.config).

::alert{type=info}
You don't have to use Typescript to build an application with Nuxt. However, it is strongly recommended to use the `.ts` extension for the `nuxt.config` file. This way you can benefit from hints in your IDE to avoid typos and mistakes while editing your configuration.

## tsconfig.json

Nuxt automatically generates a `.nuxt/tsconfig.json` file with the resolved aliases you are using in your Nuxt project, as well as with other sensible defaults.

You can benefit from this by creating a [`tsconfig.json`](/guide/concepts/typescript) in the root of your project with the following content:

```json
{
  "extends": "./.nuxt/tsconfig.json"
}
```

As you need to, you can customize the contents of this file. However, note that if you need to customize your `paths`, this will override the auto-generated path aliases. Instead, we recommend that you add any path aliases you need to the `alias` property within your `nuxt.config`, where they will get picked up and added to the autogenerated `tsconfig`.
