Before getting started, please make sure you have installed the recommended setup.

* **Node.js**<sup>*</sup> (latest LTS version) ðŸ‘‰ [[Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)]
* **Visual Studio Code** ðŸ‘‰ [[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)]
* **Volar Extension** ðŸ‘‰ [[Download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar)]
  * Either enable [**Take Over Mode**](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471) (recommended)
  * ... or add **TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)** ðŸ‘‰ [[Download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin)]

If you have enabled **Take Over Mode** or installed the **TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)** you can disable generating the shim for `*.vue` files:

```js
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  typescript: {
    shim: false
  }
})
```

::

## New project

Open a terminal, or from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), open an [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) and use the following command to create a new starter project:

::code-group

```bash [npx]
npx nuxi init nuxt3-app
```

```bash [yarn2]
yarn dlx nuxi init nuxt3-app
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dlx nuxi init nuxt3-app
```

::

Open `nuxt3-app` folder in visual studio code:

```bash
code nuxt3-app
```

Install the dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn install
```

```bash [npm]
npm install
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

::

## Development server

Now you'll be able to use `yarn dev` to start your nuxt app in development mode:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev -o
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev -- -o
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev -- -o
```

::

Well done! A browser window should automatically open for <http://localhost:3000>
