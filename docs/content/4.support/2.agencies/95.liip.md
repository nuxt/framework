fullDescription: "Liip is a Swiss digital agency with strong convictions. For more than a decade, Liip has been helping companies with their strategic digital projects – from developing innovative web applications, award-winning mobile apps and data-driven online shops, through to coaching sessions for agile ways of working. Our strategy, ideation, user experience and custom development experts create long-lasting software. Whether start-up, large company or federal authority, from retail to mobility, our projects are used by thousands of users.


Rather than just offering standard solutions, we strive for real progress: user-centred innovations with a social, environmental and economic impact for our customers. Liip works in an agile way in self-organised teams using Holacracy. This means no bosses, just lots of entrepreneurship and drive – and even more open source, creative problem solving, testing and new technologies. This is valued by not only our around 200 employees, but also customers and award panels."
