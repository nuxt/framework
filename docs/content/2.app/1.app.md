# App.vue

The new `app.vue` file, is the main component in your Nuxt3 applications.

If you would like to customize default layout of website, create `app.vue` in your project directory. Nuxt will automatically detect it and load it as the parent of all other pages within your application.


**Note:** Don't forget to use `<NuxtPage>` component somewhere inside `app.vue`.

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <NuxtPage />
  </div>
</template>
```
