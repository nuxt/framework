# Layouts

Nuxt provides a customizable layouts framework you can use throughout your application, ideal for extracting common UI or code patterns into reusable layout components.

Layouts are placed in the `layouts/` directory and will be automatically loaded via asynchronous import when used. If you create a `layouts/default.vue` this will be used for all pages in your app. Other layouts are used by setting a `layout` property as part of your component options.

## Example: a custom layout

```bash
-| layouts/
---| custom.vue
```

In your layout files, you'll need to use `<slot />` to define where the page content of your layout will be loaded. For example:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    Some shared layout content:
    <slot />
  </div>
</template>
```

Given the example above, you can use a custom layout like this:

```vue
<script>
  export default {
    layout: 'custom'
  }
</script>
```

## Example: using with slots

You can also take full control (for example, with slots) by using the `<NuxtLayout>` component (which is globally available throughout your application) _instead_ of setting `layout` in your component options.

```vue
<template>
  <NuxtLayout layout="custom">
    <template #header>
      Some header template content.
    </template>

    The rest of the page
  </NuxtLayout>
</template>
```
