# Pages

Nuxt will automatically integrate [Vue Router](https://next.router.vuejs.org/) and map `pages/` directory into the routes of your application.

## Dynamic Routes

If you place anything within square brackets, it will be turned into a [dynamic route](https://next.router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/dynamic-matching.html) parameter. You can mix and match multiple parameters and even non-dynamic text within a file name or directory.

### Example

```bash
-| pages/
---| index.vue
---| users-[group]/
-----| [id].vue
```

Given the example above, you can access group/userid within your component via the `$route` object:

```vue
<template>
  {{ $route.params.group }}
  {{ $route.params.id }}
</template>
```

## Layouts

Nuxt provides a customizable layouts framework you can use throughout your application, ideal for extracting common UI or code patterns into reusable layout components.

Page layouts are placed in the `layouts/` directory and will be automatically loaded via asynchronous import when used. If you create a `layouts/default.vue` this will be used for all pages in your app. Other layouts are used by setting a `layout` property as part of your component options.

If you have only single layout for application, you can alternatively use (app entry)[/app].

### Example: a custom layout

```bash
-| layouts/
---| custom.vue
```

In your layout files, you'll need to use `<slot />` to define where the page content of your layout will be loaded. For example:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    Some shared layout content:
    <slot />
  </div>
</template>
```

Given the example above, you can use a custom layout like this:

```vue
<script>
export default {
  layout: "custom",
};
</script>
```

### Example: using with slots

You can also take full control (for example, with slots) by using the `<NuxtLayout>` component (which is globally available throughout your application) and set `layout: false` in your component options.

```vue
<template>
  <NuxtLayout name="custom">
    <template #header> Some header template content. </template>

    The rest of the page
  </NuxtLayout>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  layout: false,
};
</script>
```
