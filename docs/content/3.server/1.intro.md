# Overview

In Nuxt3 there is a new server/rendering engine, called Nitro. It has:

- Cross-platform support for Node.js, browser, service worker targets and more
- Serverless support out-of-the-box
- Automatic route-splitting and async-loaded chunks
- Hybrid mode for static + serverless sites
- A development mode with hot module reloading

In addition it is backwards compatible with Nuxt 2 via [a compatibility module](/server/compat).

## Route handling layer

Server [API endpoints](/server/api) and [middleware](/server/middleware) are managed by an internal h3 instance. There are a number of key features, including:

* handlers can directly return objects/arrays for an automatically-handled JSON response
* handlers can return promises, which will be awaited (`res.end()` and `next()` are also supported)
* helper functions for body parsing, cookie handling, redirects, headers and more

 Check out [the h3 docs](https://github.com/unjs/h3) for more information.

## Internal API calls

Nitro allows 'internal' calling of routes via the globally-available `$fetch` helper. This will make an API call to the server if run on the browser, but will simply call the relevant function if run on the server, saving an additional API call. This is powered by ohmyfetch, with key features including:

* automatic parsing of JSON responses (with access to raw response if needed)
* request body and params are automatically handled, with correct `Content-Type` headers being added

For more information on `$fetch` features, check out [ohmyfetch](https://github.com/unjs/ohmyfetch).

## Notable differences with Nuxt 2

* Nitro produces a standalone server. The server in Nuxt 2 was not standalone, but required running `nuxt start` (with the `nuxt-start` or `nuxt` distributions) or custom programmatic usage, which was fragile and prone to breakage.
