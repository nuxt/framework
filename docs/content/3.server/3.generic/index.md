# Deployment (generic)

There are four provided generic presets for Nuxt Nitro that you can use out-of-the-box:

1. [NodeJS server](/server/generic/server)
1. [NodeJS function](/server/generic/node)
1. [Lambda function](/server/generic/lambda)
1. [Service worker](/server/generic/worker)

If you need to [create a custom preset](/build/generic/custom), that's possible too. ðŸš€

You may also want to check out the docs for [platform presets that are supported out-of-the-box](/build/platforms).
