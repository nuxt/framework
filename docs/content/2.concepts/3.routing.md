# Routing

Nuxt automatically generates the [vue-router](https://next.router.vuejs.org) configuration based on your Vue files inside the `pages/` directory.

## File-system routing

## Dynamic routing

## Nesting

## Add routes dynamically

One major feature of Nuxt 3 is that the `pages/` directory is optional, meaning that if you only use [App.vue](/docs/app/main), vue-router won't be included, reducing your application bundle size.

## Example
