# Rendering modes

Browsers and servers can interpret Javascript code to turn Vue components into actual HTML elements. This step is called **rendering**. Nuxt supports both **client-side** and **universal** rendering, the two approaches have pros and cons that we will cover in this section.

## Client-side Rendering

Out of the box, a traditional Vue application is rendered in the browser (or **client**). The HTML is built by Vue after the browser downloads and parses all the Javascript code containing the instructions to build the current interface.

![Users have to wait for the javascript to be downloaded, parsed and run before seeing the page's content](/img/concepts/rendering/light/csr.svg){.dark:hidden}
![Users have to wait for the javascript to be downloaded, parsed and executated before seeing the page's content](/img/concepts/rendering/dark/csr.svg){.light:hidden}

While this technique allows to build complex and dynamic UIs with smooth page transitions, it has different pros and cons:

### Pros

- **Development speed**: When working fully on the client, we don’t have to worry about the server compatibility of the code, for example by using browser-only APIs like the `window` object.
- **Cheaper:** Running a server adds a cost of infrastructure as you would need to run on a platform that supports Javascript. Client-only applications can be hosted on any static server, just as HTML or CSS files.

### Cons

- **Performance** : The user has to wait for the browser to download and parse javascript files. Depending on the network for the download part and the user's device for the parsing and execution, this can take some time and impact your users experience.
- **Search Engine Optimization** : Indexing the content delivered via client-side rendering takes more time than an HTML document already built. This is related to the performance drawback we talked about, as search engine crawler won't wait for the interface to be fully displayed in their first try to index the page. With pure client-side rendering, your content will take more time to show up in Search results pages.

### Examples

Client-side rendering is a good choice for heavily interactive **web applications** that don’t need indexing, or will be frequently used by the same users as it can leverage browser caching to skip the download phase on subsequent visits, such as **SaaS, back office applications or Web Games**.

## Universal Rendering

With universal rendering, when the browser requests it, a fully rendered HTML page is returned to the browser. Whether the page has been generated in advance and cached or whether it is rendered on the fly, at some point Nuxt has run the Javascript (Vue) code in a server environment, producing an HTML document. Users immediately get the content of our application, contrary to client-side rendering. This step is similar to traditional **server-side rendering** performed by PHP or Ruby applications.

To not lose the benefits of client-side rendering, such as dynamic interfaces and pages transitions, the javascript code that ran on the server is loaded by the client on the background once the HTML document has been served. Once it is interpreted again by the browser (hence **Universal rendering**), Vue takes control of the document, and enables interactivity.

This process of making a static page dynamic in the browser is called “Hydration”.

Universal rendering allows a Nuxt application to provide to the users quick page load times, while preserving the benefits of client-side rendering. As the content is already present in the HTML document, search engines crawlers can also index it without overheads.

![Users can access the static content when the HTML document is loaded. Hydration then allows page's interactivity](/img/concepts/rendering/light/ssr.svg){.dark:hidden}
![Users can access the static content when the HTML document is loaded. Hydration then allows page's interactivity](/img/concepts/rendering/dark/ssr.svg){.light:hidden}

### Pros

- **Performance**: Users can get immediate access to the page’s content, because browsers can display static content much faster than Javascript-generated one. At the same time, Nuxt preserves the interactivity of a web application when the hydration process happens.
- **SEO:** Universal rendering delivers the full HTML content of the page to the browser as a classic server application. Web crawlers can directly index the content of the page, which makes Universal rendering a great choice for any content that you want to index quickly.

### Cons

- **Development constraints:** Server and browser environments don’t provide the same APIs, and it can be tricky to write code that can run on both sides seamlessly. Fortunately, Nuxt provides guidelines and specific variables to help you determine where a piece of code is executed.

### Examples

Universal rendering is very versatile and can fit almost any use-case, and is especially appropriate for any content-oriented websites: **blog, marketing websites, portfolio, E-commerce, Marketplaces.**

## Summary

Client-side and universal rendering are different strategies to display an interface in a browser.

By default, Nuxt uses **universal rendering** to provide a better performance and optimize search engines indexation, but you can switch rendering modes in [one line of configuration](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/nuxt.config#ssr).

## Coming in Nuxt 3

Universal rendering as performed in Nuxt 2 offers a good user and developer experience in most of the cases. Nuxt 3 takes universal rendering a step further, by introducing hybrid rendering and edge-side rendering.

### Hybrid Rendering

Hybrid rendering gives the ability to use different caching rules per routes, and decide how the server should respond to a new request on a given route.

At the moment, every page (or **route**) of a Nuxt application must use the same rendering mode, client-side or universal. But in various cases, some pages could be generated at build time, while other should be client-side rendered. For example, think of a content website with an admin section. Every content page should be mostly static and generated once, but the admin section requires registration and behaves more like a dynamic application.

### Edge-side Rendering

Nitro is the new [server engine](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/concepts/server-engine) that powers Nuxt 3. It offers cross-platform support for Node.js, Deno, Workers and more. Nitro has been designed with serverless rendering in mind, and allows to render a Nuxt application at the edge: closer to your users, allowing replication and further optimizations.
