# Hybrid Rendering

Nuxt 3 comes with an improved support for rendering your Vue application, mixing both on-demand rendering and pre-rendering for best performances and build time.

## What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-side rendering (SSR), is the ability of an application to contribute by displaying the web-page on the server instead of rendering it in the browser. Server-side sends a fully rendered page to the client; the client's JavaScript bundle takes over which then allows the Vue.js app to hydrate and bring full interactivity to the page.

## On-demand Rendering





## Pre-rendering

Pre-rendering, also called static site generation, render your application during the build phase (`nuxt build`). Each page that you want to pre-render will be generated into a HTML file.
