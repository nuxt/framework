# TypeScript

Nuxt 3 is fully typed and provides helpful shortcuts to ensure you have access to accurate type information when you are coding.

## Auto-generated types

When you run `nuxi dev` or `nuxi build`, a `nuxt.d.ts` file will be auto-generated at the root of your project with the types of any modules you are using, as well as the key types that Nuxt 3 requires. Your IDE should recognise these types automatically. It is your choice whether to commit it to version control, but you shouldn't need to do so.

Some of the references in the file are to files that are generated within your `buildDir` (`.nuxt`) and therefore for full typings, you will need to run `nuxi dev` to generate the directory.

Nitro also [auto-generates types](/concepts/server-engine#typed-api-routes) for API routes.
