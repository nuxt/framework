# TypeScript

Nuxt 3 is fully typed and provides helpful shortcuts to ensure you have access to accurate type information when you are coding.

## Auto-generated types

When you run `nuxi dev` or `nuxi build`, the following files are generated for IDE type support (and type-checking):

### `.nuxt/nuxt.d.ts`

This file contains the types of any modules you are using, as well as the key types that Nuxt 3 requires. Your IDE should recognize these types automatically.

Some of the references in the file are to files that are only generated within your `buildDir` (`.nuxt`) and therefore for full typings, you will need to run `nuxi dev` or `nuxi build`.

### `.nuxt/tsconfig.json`

This file contains the recommended basic TypeScript configuration for your project, including resolved aliases injected by Nuxt or modules you are using, so you can get full type support and path auto-complete for aliases like `~/file` or `#build/file`.

[Read more about how to extend this configuration](/docs/directory-structure/tsconfig).

Nitro also [auto-generates types](/concepts/server-engine#typed-api-routes) for API routes. Plus, Nuxt also generates types for globally available components and [auto-imports from your composables](/docs/directory-structure/composables), plus other core functionality.
