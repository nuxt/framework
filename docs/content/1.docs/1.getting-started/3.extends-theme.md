# Extends Theme

One core feature of Nuxt is the extends feature. You can extend the default theme of Nuxt to create your own theme. This allows you to customize the default theme, config, and files.

You can extend mostly everything in a Nuxt project. For example. ***(These are just a few examples of what you can extend)***

::list{type="success"}
- `components/*` - Extend the default components
- `composables/*` - Extend the default composables
- `pages/*` - Extend the default vue pages
- `server/*` - Extend the default server endpoints & middleware
- `nuxt.config.ts` - Extend the default nuxt config
- `app.config.ts` - Extend the default app config
::

## How do I use extends feature?

::alert{type="info"}
When using the extends feature, you want to make sure that you have `nuxt.config.ts` in extends folder or within the repo that you are extending for nuxt to automatically register the extends.
::

You can extend the default theme by adding the [extends](/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config#extends) property to the `nuxt.config.ts` file.

### Basic Usuage

The basic usage is to add folder within your nuxt project and then add the files you want to extend.

::code-group

  ```ts{}[nuxt.config.ts]
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    extends: [
      './base'
    ]
  })
  ```

  ```vue{}[app.vue]
    <template>
      <BaseComponent/>
    </template>
  ```

  ```ts{}[base/nuxt.config.ts]
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      // Extending from base nuxt.config.ts!
      app: {
        head: {
          title: 'Extending Configs are Fun!',
          meta: [
            { name: 'description', content: 'I am using the extends feature in nuxt 3!' }
          ],
        }
      }
    })
  ```

  ```vue{}[base/components/BaseComponent.vue]
    <template>
      <h1>Extending Components is Fun!</h1>
    </template>
  ```

::

### Advanced Usage

To uses extends to it's full potential, you can create a **node module** (*has to be published first) or a **repo** that contains the files you want to extend. This allows you to share your config with others, use it in multiple projects or use it privately.

To get started you want to init the `nuxt-themes/starter` package. This will create a basic structure for you to start with -- now you can execute this command within terminal.

```bash
npx nuxi init --template gh:nuxt-themes/starter my-theme
```

Now you can read the readme file that was created to get started!

#### Remote Sources Usage

::alert{type="info"}
If you want to use extends for `github:`, `bitbucket:`, `gitlab:` or `https:` on a private remote source, you need to add an environmen variable `GIGET_AUTH=<tokenHere>` for it to download the files.
::

```ts{}[nuxt.config.ts]
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    extends: [
      // Github Remote Source example
      'github:username/repoName',
      // GitLab Remote Source example
      'gitlab:username/repoName',
      // Bitbucket Remote Source example
      'bitbucket:username/repoName',
      // HTTPS Remote Source example
      'https//github.com/username/repoName',
    ]
  })
```

#### Node Module Usage

To use `extends` with a node module, you need to make sure that the module is published to npm. Then you can use the module name to extend the current nuxt config.

::alert{type="warning"}
If you have a **private** node module, you need to make sure you login, to authenticate with npm to download the node module.
::

```ts{}[nuxt.config.ts]
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    extends: [
      // Node Module with scope
      '@npmScope/moduleName',
      // or just the module name
      'moduleName'
    ]
  })
```

In order to use as a node module, you want to make sure that the `package.json` has the correct `files` & `main` properties filled out. This will make sure that the files are included when the node module is published.

```json{}[package.json]
  {
    "name": "my-theme",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "My Theme",
    "main": "./nuxt.config.ts",
    "files": [
      "nuxt.config.ts",
      "app.config.ts",
      "components",
      "composables",
      "server"
    ]
  }
```

Now you can proceed to publish the module to npm module either `public` or `private`.
