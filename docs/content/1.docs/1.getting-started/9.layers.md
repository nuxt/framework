# Layers

One core feature of Nuxt 3 is the layers and extending feature. You can extend a default Nuxt application to reuse components, utils, configuraion or even use it as a complete Theme. Layers structure is almost identical to a stanard Nuxt application which makes them easy to author and maintain. Some example usecases:

::list{type="success"}
- Share reusable configuration presets across projects using `nuxt.config` and `app.config`
- Create a component library using `components/` directory
- Share composables and utilities library using `composables/` and `utils/` directories
- Create Nuxt themes
- Create Nuxt Module Presets
- Share Standard Setup Across projects
::

You can extend the default theme by adding the [extends](/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config#extends) property to the `nuxt.config.ts` file.

```ts{}[app/nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    '../base',                        // Extend from a local layer
    '@my-themes/awesome',             // Extend from an install npm package layer
    'github:my-themes/awesome#v1',  // Extend from a git repository
  ]
})
```
