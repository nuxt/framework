> How to deploy Nuxt to Vercel with Nuxt Nitro

 - Support for serverless SSR build
 - Auto-detected when deploying
 - No configuration required

## Setup

By default, Vercel will run your `build` script in the `package.json` and automatically detect the built entrypoint within `.vercel_build_output/`.

## Deployment

Just push to your git repository [as you would normally for Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/git).

## More information

See [more information on the node preset](/deployment/presets/node) for full details.

## Demo

A live demo is available at https://nitro-demo.vercel.app/
