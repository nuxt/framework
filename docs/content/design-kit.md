Nuxt Logo
#description
The logo is made from two elements: the triangular mountains and the wordmark. In most cases, they should appear together as the opposite master lockup shows. The triangular mountains can be used on their own as an icon, profile picture or badge, but the wordmark should never be used without this symbol on the side.

Roobert font
#description
Our brand typeface is Roobert PRO by the Display Foundry. This typeface was chosen for itâ€™s aesthetic reminding the shape of Nuxt logo by many aspects (joints, apex, vertex of the structure). It provides modernity and sobriety while giving an iconic aspect of our visual content and without decreasing the accessibility of texts.<br /><br />
Font is also variable which allows us to fit with any contexts.
#typography
[Roobert PRO]{ .text-5xl }

[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.]{ .text-4xl }

Usage
#description
For Nuxt brand, we will only use Regular / Medium / Semibold / Bold weights 99% of the time. You should avoid Light & Heavy if you want to use it as Nuxt Identity. Only exceptions are for super, subscript characters, also you can use heavy if you go upper than 72px for a font size.
As Roobert font is licensed, you cannot use it for free so you can use the [Inter font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter){.font-semibold .text-green-400} as an alternative. If you want to have visuals with Roobert official font, contact us we will give you the asset ready.
