# `throwError`

Nuxt provides a quick and simple way to throw errors.

Within your pages, components and plugins you can use `throwError` to throw an error.

**Parameters:**

- `error`: `string | Error`

```js
throwError("ðŸ˜± Oh no, an error has been thrown.")
```

The thrown error is set in the state using [`useError()`](/api/composables/use-error) to create a reactive and SSR-friendly shared error state across components.

`throwError` calls the `app:error` hook.
