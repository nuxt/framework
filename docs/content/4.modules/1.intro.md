# Nuxt Modules

Nuxt modules allow encapsulating features and detailed customization of how Nuxt works. You can use them to add features simply within your own project, or publish a library for others to use.

You can browse through a list of community-provided Nuxt modules at [modules.nuxtjs.org](https://modules.nuxtjs.org/), or via [GitHub discovery](https://github.com/topics/nuxt-module)

**Note**:
Not all current Nuxt modules are compatible with Nuxt3, in particular modules that have a runtime component. Module authors should consult [the documentation on creating compatible modules](/modules/kit), and please feel free to file an issue on the module repository to track progress.
