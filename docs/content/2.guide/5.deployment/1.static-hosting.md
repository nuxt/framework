# Static Hosting

Static site generation (SSG) renders every route of your application at build time. For every page, Nuxt uses a crawler to generate a corresponding HTML file. You can then deploy your application to any static hosting services.

This feature is still experimental and under development for Nuxt 3.

## Activate static mode

Change the `target` property to `static` in the `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  target: 'static'
})
```

## Command

Use the [`nuxi generate` command](/api/commands/generate) to build you application. The HTML files will be generated in the `.output/public` directory.

```bash
npx nuxi generate
```
