# Static Hosting

Static site generation (SSG) prerenders every route of your application at build time. For every page, Nuxt uses a crawler to generate a corresponding HTML file. You can then deploy your application to any static hosting services.

This feature is still experimental and under development for Nuxt 3.

## Command

Use the [`nuxi generate` command](/api/commands/generate) to build your application. The HTML files will be generated in the `.output/public` directory.

```bash
npx nuxi generate
```
