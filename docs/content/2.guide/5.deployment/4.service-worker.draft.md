Deployment as a service worker has some limitations since SSR code is not running in Node.js environment but pure JavaScript.

## Usage

You can use the [Nuxt config](/guide/directory-structure/nuxt.config) to explicitly set the preset to use:

```js [nuxt.config.js|ts]
export default {
  nitro: {
    'service-worker'
  }
}
```

Or directly use the `NITRO_PRESET` environment variable when running `nuxt build`:

```bash
NITRO_PRESET=service-worker npx nuxt build
```

## Entry point

The worker preset produces a service worker that can provide full HTML rendering within a worker context (for example [Cloudflare Workers](/guide/deployment/cloudflare)). It registers appropriate handlers for `fetch`, `install` and `activate`.

For more information, you can check out the [source code](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/blob/main/src/presets/service-worker.ts).
