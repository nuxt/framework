# Static Hosting

::alert{type=info}
The [full static feature](https://nuxtjs.org/announcements/going-full-static) is [under development](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/issues/6411) and will be available in the near future.
::

There are two ways to deploy a Nuxt application to any static hosting services:

- Static site generation (SSG) prerenders every route of your application at build time. For every page, Nuxt uses a crawler to generate a corresponding HTML file.
- Using `ssr: false` to produce a pure client-side output.

## Prerendering

Use the [`nuxi generate` command](/api/commands/generate) to build your application. The HTML files will be generated in the `.output/public` directory.

```bash
npx nuxi generate
```

## Client-side Only Rendering

If you don't want to prerender your routes, another way of using static hosting is to set the `ssr` property to `false` in the `nuxt.config` file. The `nuxi build` command will then output an `index.html` entrypoint like a classic client-side Vue.js application.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts|js]
defineNuxtConfig({
  ssr: false
})
```

## Advanced

You can manually specify routes that [Nitro](/guide/concepts/server-engine) will fetch and prerender during the build.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts|js]
defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      routes: ['/user/1', '/user/2']
    }
  }
})
```
