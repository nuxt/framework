You can benefit from this by creating a [`tsconfig.json`](/guide/concepts/typescript) in the root of your project with the following content:

```json
{
  "extends": "./.nuxt/tsconfig.json"
}
```

As you need to, you can customize the contents of this file. However, note that if you need to customize your `paths`, this will override the auto-generated path aliases. Instead, we recommend that you add any path aliases you need to the `alias` property within your `nuxt.config`, where they will get picked up and added to the autogenerated `tsconfig`.
