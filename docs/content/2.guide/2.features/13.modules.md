# Modules

Nuxt applications can be extended by modules, mainly developed by the Nuxt community. You can find all [Nuxt 3 modules](https://modules.nuxtjs.org/?version=3.x) here. Everyone has the opportunity to develop modules, read more about developing modules in the [Module Author Guide](/guide/going-further/modules).

Modules make working with Nuxt much easier, you don't have to develop everything from scratch, they can be easily configured in [`nuxt.config`](/api/configuration/nuxt.config#modules).
