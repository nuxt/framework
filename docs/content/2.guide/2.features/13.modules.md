# Modules

Nuxt modules make integrations super simple. You don't have to develop everything from scratch nor bear with maintaining an extra boilerplate when there is already a Nuxt module for it. Adding Nuxt modules is possible using [`nuxt.config`](/api/configuration/nuxt.config#modules).

You can find a list of [Nuxt 3 compatible modules here](https://modules.nuxtjs.org/?version=3.x).

Everyone has the opportunity to develop modules. Read more about developing modules in the [Module Author Guide](/guide/going-further/modules).
