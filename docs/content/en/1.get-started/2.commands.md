# Commands

Nuxt 3 only has two commands, one in development and one to ship for production.

Since Nuxt 3 becomes a dev dependency thanks to [Nuxt Nitro](/nitro), you only need to add two commands in your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nuxt dev",
  "build": "nuxt build",
}
```

Then, you can run each command using `yarn <command>` or `npm run <command>`.

## Development server

To launch Nuxt in development mode with hot module replacement on http://localhost:3000:

::code-group
```bash[Yarn]
yarn dev
```
```bash[NPM]
npm run dev
```
::

## Building for production

To build your Nuxt application for production, run:

::code-group
```bash[Yarn]
yarn build
```
```bash[NPM]
npm run build
```
::

Nuxt will create a `.output` directory with all your application, server and dependencies ready to be deployed. Checkout the [deployment](/deployment) section to learn where and how you can deploy a Nuxt application using Nitro.
