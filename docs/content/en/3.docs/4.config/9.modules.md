> Modules are Nuxt extensions which can extend its core functionality and add endless integrations

Each module is either a string (which can refer to a package, or be a path to a file), a tuple with the module as first string and the options as a second object, or an inline module function.
Nuxt tries to resolve each item in the modules array using node require path (in `node_modules`) and then will be resolved from project `srcDir` if `~` alias is used.

**Note**: Modules are executed sequentially so the order is important.

**Example**:
```js
modules: [
  // Using package name
  '@nuxtjs/axios',
  // Relative to your project srcDir
  '~/modules/awesome.js',
  // Providing options
  ['@nuxtjs/google-analytics', { ua: 'X1234567' }],
  // Inline definition
  function () {}
]
```
