# publicRuntimeConfig

> Runtime config allows passing dynamic config and environment variables to the Nuxt app context.

It is added to the Nuxt payload so there is no need to rebuild to update your configuration in development or if your application is served by the Nuxt server. (For static sites you will still need to regenerate your site to see changes.)
The value of this object is accessible from both client and server using `$config`. It should hold env variables that are _public_ as they will be accessible on the frontend. This could include a reference to your public URL.

**Example**:
```js
export default {
  publicRuntimeConfig: {
    baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL || 'https://nuxtjs.org'
  }
}
```

## `app`

- **Type**: `object`
- **Version**: 2, 3
- **Default**
```json
{
  "basePath": "/",
  "assetsPath": "/_nuxt/",
  "cdnURL": null
}
```
