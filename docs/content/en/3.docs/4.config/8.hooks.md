Internally, hooks follow a naming pattern using colons (e.g., build:done).
For ease of configuration, you can also structure them as an hierarchical object in `nuxt.config` (as below).

**Example**:
```js
import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'
export default {
  hooks: {
    build: {
      done(builder) {
        const extraFilePath = path.join(
          builder.nuxt.options.buildDir,
          'extra-file'
        )
        fs.writeFileSync(extraFilePath, 'Something extra')
      }
    }
  }
}
```
