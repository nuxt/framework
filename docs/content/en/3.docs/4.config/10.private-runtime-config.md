> Runtime config allows passing dynamic config and environment variables to the Nuxt app context.

It is added to the Nuxt payload so there is no need to rebuild to update your configuration in development or if your application is served by the Nuxt server. (For static sites you will still need to regenerate your site to see changes.)
The value of this object is accessible from server only using `$config`.
It will override `publicRuntimeConfig` on the server-side.
It should hold _private_ environment variables (that should not be exposed on the frontend). This could include a reference to your API secret tokens.

**Example**:
```js
export default {
  privateRuntimeConfig: {
    apiSecret: process.env.API_SECRET
  }
}
```
