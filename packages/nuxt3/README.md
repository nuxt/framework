## Nuxt 3

> The Intuitive Web Framework: powered with Vue 3

This package is actually in heavy development and not open to public usage.

We plan to open a private alpha to internal debugging Q1 2021.

During Q2 2021, we will open the beta channel, with documentation and contribution processes.

Thank you very much, the [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) Team.
